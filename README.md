# Text-Sentiment-Analysis-of-Hindi-Language using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This repository contains code for performing sentiment analysis in Hindi language using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The code utilizes the Keras library for building the CNN model and Theano as the backend.

## Requirements

- Theano
- NumPy
- Keras
- scikit-learn

You can install the required Python packages by running the following command:

```bash
pip install theano numpy keras scikit-learn

**Dataset:**
The dataset used for sentiment analysis consists of positive and negative examples in Hindi. 
The positive examples are stored in the file hindi_pos.txt, and the negative examples are stored 
in the file hindi_neg.txt. Make sure to place these files in the appropriate location before running the code.

**Results**
The trained CNN model will be evaluated on the test dataset, and the accuracy of the model will be displayed in the console.

**Contributing**
Contributions to this repository are welcome.
